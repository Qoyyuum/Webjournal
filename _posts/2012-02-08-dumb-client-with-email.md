So I recently got another new client. It was supposed to be a quick development job. Basic homepage, About page, Contact page and that&#8217;s it. Attached is an image of a the web development workflow.

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/webdesignprocess.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Web Development Workflow. Now that's something." border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/webdesignprocess.gif?resize=640%2C498" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

Apparently, its not that easy. The guy that I&#8217;m dealing with have some experience in the field of applications and software but little to no experience in web development or the concept of a website.

I suppose you can call me dumb too for not being able to explain the whole &#8220;web&#8221; to a client. Perhaps I should write a simplistic guide to web for clients and just hand out. It may be a good thing to start as another project.

_To be noted&#8230;_
