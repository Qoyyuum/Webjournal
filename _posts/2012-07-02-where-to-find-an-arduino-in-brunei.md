So I saw this video on TED and it was about Arduino and its open-source goodness. I have always wanted to try my hand at electronic work but I never got the chance to. Simply because I couldn&#8217;t find a good radio shack in Brunei. Unless there is one, I really wanna know where it is. If not, I might try and buy one from Amazon.  


Why do I want one? So I can make some home automation. It only clicked me when I saw one of the booth at the Consumer Fair last week. And when I googled, oh so much open-source goodness:
