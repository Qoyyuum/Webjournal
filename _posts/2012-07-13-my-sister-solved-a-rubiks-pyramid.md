So my sister took on a challenge to see if she can solve this rubiks pyramid in the least amount of time. Her first solve took her 30 minutes or so. Couldn&#8217;t believe it myself so I told her to try it again and I&#8217;ll try to watch her do it. I scrambled it up. Passed it to her and wouldn&#8217;t you know it? She finished it in 20.
