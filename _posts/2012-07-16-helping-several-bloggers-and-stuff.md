Opened my Gmail. Read a few emails. Simultaneously, opened the following:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">www.Triond.com, ww</span><span style="background-color: white;">w.Pinterest.com, www.Bloggers.com and www.Blogger.com.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span> 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2468800.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Triond just doesn't work for a Bruneian like me. But it somehow gives me an idea for a new web project. Created a new idea file for the folder." border="0" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2468800.png?w=676" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">Still pondering on what to do with my account at Triond. Really tough to decide. Got an idea regarding Skrill. Added to &#8220;idea&#8221; folder. Closed Triond.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span> 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/27244_1223646995860_1369538148_30508534_1988222_n.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Rosi Georgrieva, a new upcoming logo designer for the web. Someone to keep an eye out." border="0" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/27244_1223646995860_1369538148_30508534_1988222_n.jpg?w=676" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">At Bloggers.com, checked on updated talks. Found a couple that interests me. The Blogger, <a href="https://plus.google.com/107704942529885012042/posts">Rosi Georgrieva</a>, aka CupCakeLover, is into Logo Design. I suggested her to go into <a href="http://99designs.com/">99designs.com</a> and enter some logo design competition to recognize her artistic talents. Also because she has some ready-made logo designs made, she could add them to a Behance Network portfolio. Assisting like an ASSISTANT! (Or so to speak)</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">At LinkedIn, I received a message from John Wingate, who appears to be new in the whole Blogosphere. Told him to update his <a href="http://realestatehomenetwork.com/blog/">blog</a> title with something more into real estate and fill in his meta description. Settings like these are always a must to get a blog up and running and get hooked up by the Search Engines. Helping like a BOSS!</span>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/John-WIngate.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="John Wingate is really into Real Estate. Probably trying to gain more clients via Blogging. I'll help him out from time to time." border="0" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/John-WIngate.png?resize=400%2C271" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

<span style="background-color: white;">At Pinterest, a couple of girls, <a href="http://pinterest.com/kidagara/">Akirhen</a> and Lindsay Cline saw <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/258675572317795279/">my pin on HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript tutorial resources</a> and repinned to their board. It feels great to share.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
At time of writing, now playing music: Foo Fighters &#8211; Best of You. Feels like I&#8217;m rocking down the web roads. (i.e. travelling between sites).  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">Before posting this, I edited my IFTTT&#8217;s recipe of using; RSS Feed to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to Blogger Feed to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">I have decided to blog like this with the occasional vlogging with PowToons or other useful web apps.</span>  
<span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span>  
<span style="background-color: white;">Still need to tweak a little more on my IFTTT recipes.</span>
