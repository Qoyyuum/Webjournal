# Google Plus
Back into Google+, I realized its a lot less cluttered than before. Honestly, the look and feel of it all has become much more... simplified that I feel like I should use it again. And when I did, I realize I don't have that many active friends on this social platform (not since when I was still on Blogger). So I'm thinking, "Hey, let's make new ones!". So back to square one on this social media.

## Google Hangout
So my most recent side-work was to build this app for sign language reference. Thanks to my friend, Zul who helped me get the pictures, now its my turn to just put it all together. So I decided, I'll finish this off on Friday evening. And since I know I'll be online that evening, I might as well hangout with like-minded people on Google+. So I [scheduled for one](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cniklh2dnfgkimm8tbnviedr28o?authkey=CLTN68yv-Lm58gE).

So this Friday, 19/02/2016, at 8pm (GMT+8), I'm holding an public hangout for everyone to come and chat. The topic is about hybrid app building but we can talk about something else, no problem.

Until then, I'll be busy. Might update this with a Youtube video of the recorded hangout of what happened.
