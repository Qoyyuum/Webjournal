I sent a feedback on this (I think about last year or so), several other bloggers feel the same through the Google Groups.

I have noticed several changes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/112893701314508522131" target="_blank">+Google Drive</a>&nbsp;and was hoping if they can actually keep up with the development rolling with an added feature: **ADDING GOOGLE DRIVE TO BLOGGER&#8217;S BLOGPOST!**

<div data-href="https://plus.google.com/103307601841731531327/posts/5t5EcMBDNmV">
</div>

Let&#8217;s check out the responses later (i.e. if they respond).
