Among the Bloggers Community, there&#8217;s Jayme. Upon seeing her [blog](http://jaymesstorytime.blogspot.com/), I didn&#8217;t actually think of it but that&#8217;s actually a good example of crowdsourcing. I joined in the story time just for the fun of it. If there were more story time tellers out there, her blog would be so much fun. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Sadly, there's just not enough of a crowd." border="0" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/StoryCorner.png?resize=400%2C156" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

I saw one similar to this concept but it wasn&#8217;t writing a story. It was the author drawing out the story by the community&#8217;s comments and highest rated votes. Gotta find that website. Last I read, it was an experiment. I believe [Rob Denbleyker](https://plus.google.com/109384784623056332691) was the owner of the site, I remembered that much but I don&#8217;t remember how I got there.
