Freakin&#8217; dilemma. I&#8217;ve got skills in Business <u>AND</u> IT. I love coding more than doing business. But doing business would get me more money than coding. Hence, the dilemma. I&#8217;m in need of money but I can&#8217;t do it with the passion for web programming. And yet, I bore myself with Business strategies and management but it does give good payouts.

Probably, by logic here is that I should dump all this IT stuff and just focus on Business for now. Once the greens are good and flowing, _then_ I&#8217;ll do the coding as much as I want.

However, another dilemma comes around as I began to think deeper. In order to get that kind of passive income going, I have to do some coding too. Basically, a web application that runs 24/7 and I don&#8217;t have to be there to do anything.

How I see it, FIRST: Code the product/service. SECOND: Market it out. And that&#8217;s it.

I could use some feedback on this dilemma. Comment if you&#8217;ve got an idea. I might wing it.
