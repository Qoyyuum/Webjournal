<div>
  So I have this idea. And it just so happen to be a really interesting accessory. You can visit my idea via <a href="http://www.quirky.com/ideations/173839?sc=true">this link</a>. But I think it needs some improvement, so if you have an idea or two on how to make it better, leave it in the comment section there. In return, I&#8217;ll give you a percentage of the profits.

> **The Problem**  
> How many times have you forgotten to bring your flash drive to work when you need to transfer files or an important presentation? Sure there&#8217;s cloud applications to help you with that but what if you don&#8217;t have access to any Internet connection? For IT Coordinators and Computer Technicians, we need to bring all of our software with us at all times; for rapid installations, quick presentations, ready-made custom templates, quick transfers, etc. Usually we just put these flash drives in our bag but the fear of getting them crushed by our laptops, heavy thick documents or our stationary can cause them to go corrupted.</p>
> **The Proposed Solution**  
> A wristband with about 4 elastic slots for USB drives and gadgets and a slot for watches, you can now carry what you need as if its one small little bag. And best of all, its always by your wrist. No more dangling by your neck with a phone strap for different flash drives. Need a pen? Slot it in there! Need a place to slot your ipod shuffle/nano? Slot it in there! Also for an added feature, proximity sensor on your wristband and a receiver to your bag. Before you leave with your bag, your receiver will ping back to the proximity sensor. If its too far, the receiver will make an alarming noise to tell us to get our wristband that we &#8220;accidentally&#8221; leave behind.</p>
> **Product Key Features** 
> 
>   1. Has a proximity sensor with an alarming noise. We won&#8217;t forget the necessities before we leave home/work.
>   2. An added accessory for the working individuals. Bring all the flash drives, pens, and even a watch in one wristband!
>   3. 4 slots horizontally placed on the wristband. Elastic capability for different sizes.
>   4. 1 special slot vertically placed on the wristband for people wearing watches/bracelets.
>   5. Design-friendly. Can be as stylish as we can imagine.
