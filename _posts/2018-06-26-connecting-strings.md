I have been reading a lot of ebooks lately. Well, about 4 ebooks. Most of them about personal development and trying to get out of this rut that I'm feeling. It's ridiculous when I've achieved my objective and supposed to just progress to my next milestone but that's not happening when I'm feeling emotionally burden of my decision. It's like that gut-wrenching feeling that anyone would get after a rush that kinda prevents you to move forward. Or the body is yelling out to stop and smell the flowers once in a while, but that's illogical. Either I progress forward or move backwards by standing still.

## So Who Am I?

Just as my previous post, I found some more leads to my identity of who I am. Nothing concrete but I think I'm more of a person who just wants to make a change, to make an impact, a difference to something. Not exactly to change the world, or to make a great impact to my self but to change something. Something has to change. I don't know what but something. And this is coming from within me. And then, I figured out what I'm doing. I'm struggling.

## The Jihad

That's it! I'm struggling to find out who I am and what I am supposed to be and supposed to do. So I tried going through all the ayat and surahs in the Quran (kinda skimmed) to see if anything resonates. Nothing. Tried meditation and prayed for answers. Nothing. Really struggling to figure this part out. My next idea is to try to find answers in my surroundings, starting with my family.

## Strengthening My Family Bonds

Loving my wife, my son and my family. Maybe I'll find the answer to who I am as a husband, father, son and brother. Probably. I don't know what I'll find but as soon as I can get out of this rut, the better. So what I'm doing with my family is to see if I can help their troubles and problems and maybe in turn, I help myself. Sounds like how Sheldon was in a rut in one of those episodes on The Big Bang Theory.
