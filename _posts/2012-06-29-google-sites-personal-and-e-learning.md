So I&#8217;ve been working on Google Sites as of late. My Personal Site will just be a track of my side-projects and a few other things. My E-learning Site is also in the works. The only trouble I get with this Google Sites platform is the use of Gadgets. Apparently, not a lot of common webmastering gadgets are available. Unfortunately, we gotta <a href="https://developers.google.com/gadgets/docs/gs" target="_blank">make them ourselves</a>. Well, what do you expect over a free website builder, eh?

But the upside is, I get to play with it. Hehe, codes and snippets are bound to be laying around somewhere and I wanna see if I can mix them up to make something out of it.
