My Acer Aspire 4750z, HTC Wildfire, Zoom! Broadband, data cables, 4GB Pendrive, 500GB External Harddisk, are among the other gadgets and tech that I always carry around in my backpack. So I was wondering as I walked with all of those tech stuff on my back, thinking of the next tech gadget and gizmo to add to my tech pack, I also realized that I felt so attached to them. The thought of not having any tech stuff, makes me feel&#8230;. _\*brrr\*_ scared.

I know I would definitely be able live without tech in my life. No problem. I can always go on an adventure; rapid riding, cycling, and such.&nbsp; But not being able to see another line of code, just doesn&#8217;t make me feel excited about living. I guess you could say, technology saved me from the thought of going suicidal.

Would you be able to live without any tech in your life? And when I mean tech, I mean information technology. No phones, no PC, no laptops, no&#8230;

But until the time Skynet decides to invade our world on the 21st of December 2012, I&#8217;ll be having my coffee&#8230;
