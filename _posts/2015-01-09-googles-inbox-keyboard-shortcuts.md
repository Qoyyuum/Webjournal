Press Shift+? to see the Google&#8217;s Inbox Keyboard Shortcuts. I always love shortcut keys in every program and I try my best to remember each of them when I need to really get things done.

But what really interests me is, the keyboard shortcuts show using &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; and this applies to most PCs running on Windows and Linux. But what about those in Macs? How does it decide to show the &#8220;Command&#8221; key?

My guess is that it uses some sort of metadata to check the, not only the browser but also for the Operating System that the user is using when visiting or using a website or SaaS or webpage.
