I have been a student of Udemy for quite sometime now and just recently. I have just finished making the course about blogging. Well not really. I have some more information to share in the course that may help in building anybody to have a better blog and become a better blogger.

Right now, I&#8217;m setting this course as free and consider this as my learning experience to using Udemy&#8217;s interface. I have a couple more courses that I&#8217;m working on and I&#8217;m setting them up as paid courses. Though I&#8217;m still waiting for a SCORM feature implemented on Udemy so in the meantime, gotta keep building my materials. Feel free to subscribe to my Blogging course on Udemy, more updates coming soon.
