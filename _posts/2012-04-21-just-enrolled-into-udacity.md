Recently, I have enrolled into Udacity&#8217;s course [CS253: Web Application Engineering](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012). Simply because my idea for a niche marketplace application isn&#8217;t working. So I decided to take this course to help me learn the dynamics of a web app.

And throughout the course, I have just learnt about using [Python](http://python.org/) and [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/). Sweet!

So basically by Google App Engine&#8217;s service, I can host a free web application as long as it is below 5 million monthly page views then I&#8217;m golden. Considering that this web app is targeted towards Bruneians, I doubt it could hit 2 million hits but we&#8217;ll never know as I may be indirectly targeting other countries.

For those who wants to know, [Udacity&#8217;s courses](http://www.udacity.com/courses), especially CS253, does not require you to have initial programming experience. But it will make lessons easier if you do. You can learn the primary programming through Udacity or through other e-learning websites like [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com/).

I should probably make a personal web app for the fun of it and copy it over to Kodingen (soon to be renamed Koding).

At the moment, gotta stay on course.

My developing appspot:&nbsp;http://5repitcher.appspot.com/

App name is just for fun. I may still need to rename it to something else.

_To be continued&#8230;_
