I didn&#8217;t know that there is this much going on at w3schools. Last I visited was early last year. Read the whole article at <http://w3fools.com/>

And if that&#8217;s the case then, I gotta find another good basic tutorials on HTML, CSS and PHP to refer my friends and family to. I never did study these languages at w3schools. I studied them here and there. HTML at Neopets, CSS from college and PHP from Joomla development.
