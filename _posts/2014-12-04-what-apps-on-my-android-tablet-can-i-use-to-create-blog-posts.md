Answer by Abdul Qoyyuum Haji Abdul Kadir:
  


> Google Docs (<span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&quot;qtext&quot;).tooltip(this, &quot;google.com&quot;)">Android Apps on Google Play</a></span>) is a good one. By creating your blogpost in draft using Google Docs, you can then review your blogpost as many times as you want and then publish it online (as is) or copy and paste it to Blogger (<span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.blogger" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&quot;qtext&quot;).tooltip(this, &quot;google.com&quot;)">Android Apps on Google Play</a></span>) app or whatever app you have to publish posts to (i.e. WordPress, Tumblr, etc) as mentioned by <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Kevin-Gómez">Kevin Gómez</a></span>.</p>

> Some would keep the blog posts as small as taking notes. Google Keep (<span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&quot;qtext&quot;).tooltip(this, &quot;google.com&quot;)">Android Apps on Google Play</a></span>) is another cool app to do this. Take simple notes, take pictures in your notes and then when you're done, you take it onto your desktop and expand or publish it as is.
