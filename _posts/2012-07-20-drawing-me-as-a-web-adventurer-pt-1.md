I love Adventure Time with Finn and Jake. Especially when they do their shenanigans that doesn&#8217;t make sense. I wanted to try and draw myself an adventurer but I wanted to see what a regular adventurer looks like. So I googled &#8220;[How To Draw An Adventurer](https://www.google.com/search?q=adventurer&hl=en&prmd=imvns&source=lnms&sa=X&ei=QbYIUOOLAu-5iAeT5fDHCQ&ved=0CA8Q_AUoAA&biw=1366&bih=612#hl=en&sugexp=eiatsh&gs_nf=1&tok=N2ua-CE5rzCVl2dt4i63Bg&pq=adventurer&cp=25&gs_id=2q&xhr=t&q=how+to+draw+an+adventurer&pf=p&sclient=psy-ab&oq=how+to+draw+an+adventurer&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=ad0213430cbee02e&biw=1366&bih=612)&#8221; and down on the [5th result](http://www.dragoart.com/tags/tuts/1/429/how-to-draw-adventure-time-characters.htm) I found a wonderful cartoonish website. Woohoo!

And being the guy that I am, I clicked on the link to learn [how to draw Fiona](http://www.dragoart.com/tuts/3797/1/1/how-to-draw-finn.htm). What the hell was I thinking? But I quickly glanced through to understand the female body shape in art. (Not what you think) 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.dragoart.com/tuts/8002/1/1/how-to-draw-fionna,-adventure-time.htm"><img alt="Fiona is so pretty but I havn't seen her in any ATWFAJ" border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/how-to-draw-fionna-adventure-time.jpg?resize=277%2C320" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>

Then I looked at [how to draw Finn](http://www.dragoart.com/tuts/3797/1/1/how-to-draw-finn.htm). Quite simple really. Less curves, more basic shapes. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/how-to-draw-finn-step-2.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Finn drawn at Step 2." border="0" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/how-to-draw-finn-step-2.jpg?resize=168%2C320" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

<span style="text-align: left;">Gonna try and make one myself. Just for the fun of it, my objective is to draw myself as a web adventurer. With HTML5 shield, a CSS3 Armour, a PHP sword, then I remembered I played a game that have these adventuring sprites with those equipment for the NPC.</span>

Browser Quest from Mozilla:&nbsp;<http://browserquest.mozilla.org/>

A quick short game that I played several weeks ago where all the characters are in 16&#215;16 sprites.
