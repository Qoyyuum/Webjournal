I have been a very long user in Gmail. But the problem is that its not using POP3 (a separate client which stores messages/emails on your PC). So I went and tried Outlook and the first time I did was in 2009. I like Outlook but it feels very clunky. Though it met my needs to review my emails offline. Again, I&#8217;m off looking for a better alternative. I met Thunderbird. Its not bad. The interface, the add-ons, the features, etc are pretty sleek. Have not seen a downside yet. I might try something else for the fun of it. _What&#8217;s your best Email Client and why?_ If its really good, I might get one myself. <img src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=676" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" />
