# Learn UI andÂ UX part-time and online

Just recently found an exceptional course on web design and that&#8217;s from <a class="thirstylink" href="http://blog.qoyyuum.me/endorses/designlab/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DesignLab.com</a>. Several months ago, DesignLab was on the betalist for webapps for me to try out. Their beta course was very interesting, teaching online, using a web design editor to design logos, banners, webpages and a few more. However, I stopped visiting because there wasn&#8217;t much after that.

Surfing around, I stumbled upon DesignLab again and this time it was talking about learning UI and UX designs. Got my attention with its ads, I looked at the courses and I was amazed at what it can offer.

## Interested in getting a job in Web Design or App design?

I totally recommend learning from DesignLab and its intuitive web editor functionality (as opposed to downloading a crack Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop and using it illegally? You betcha!). But you better hurry though, as at the current time of writing, the next course starts on May 22nd (that&#8217;s next next Friday). <a class="thirstylink" href="http://blog.qoyyuum.me/endorses/designlab/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Go sign up!</strong></a>
