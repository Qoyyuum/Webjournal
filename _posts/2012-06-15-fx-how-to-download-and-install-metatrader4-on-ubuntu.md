So I got my EA working, downloaded from the History Centre to be double sure (and I did it last weekend), it works. Next I gotta make this run as I do other things. I surfed the net to find a way to download and install Metatrader4 on Ubuntu 12.04 (i.e. my desktop&#8217;s current OS). Not a lot of good info, but as far as I learnt through the forums, gotta install WINE in order to install it. I did just that and it works! Time to see some passive income in the next two months&#8230;
