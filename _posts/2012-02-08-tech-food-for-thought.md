Thanks to a friend of a friend of mine, there&#8217;s this idea I could use to send me an SMS if a condition is met. More like server monitoring than anything but if I can get this part right, I could leverage it for my fx journey in the coming months.

By setting up a local server onto my PC, I could have the SMS gateway send me a SMS to my phone (this would mean that I need two lines to pay for) to give me a heads up on the status of my PC. Whether the network connection is down, the power is down, the trades are lost or won, etc. Its more or less like using ifttt.com&#8217;s social channels to other social channels but more native.

Once I&#8217;ve got this set up, I could give this project system a shine for re-sale after custom tweaking it.

This SMS idea only started last year, December, where I met a potential couple of clients that requested a SMS Gateway to allow online visitors to contact their agents. I figured it was impossible since I have no idea how the Gateway works for mobile communication. It was just not my field of expertise.

So I told them that I would look into it and here I am. Though after several emails sent to them, not one email was replied regarding the project.

&#8220;Nevermind that.&#8221;, I thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just build the system and put it up for sale. Then it&#8217;s all just plug and play after pay from there.&#8221;
