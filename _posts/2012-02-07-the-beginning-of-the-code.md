I don&#8217;t know why I started this blog but in my gut feeling, I wanna start journaling my web development work in a blog.

Currently, I have this web project called WebQuest by ITPSS. A Web Development Competition on secured CMS.

My initial thoughts was to simply build a joomla site with a unique concept.

The concept was this: 

  * Have entrepreneurs log in
  * Have them interact with other entrepreneurs
  * Have embassies assists them in joint ventures, branches, registrations, legal stuff, etc.
  * That&#8217;s it.

And for this, I call it the Be2eB &#8211; Business-embassy 2 embassy-Business.
