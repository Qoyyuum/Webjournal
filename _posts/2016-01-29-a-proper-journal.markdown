What a time that we're living in. Economic crisis happening all around and I'm here writing my blog and exporting everything from my old blog to the new one. It's not much but its something. 

#Why move from Wordpress to Github?
For some, Wordpress is an awesome platform (which I'm sure it is). But it has a lot of fluff that I don't need, especially with all those plugin and base updates that I also don't need either. Too much maintenance for a personal blog, really. And most of my passion is really from the web, so might as well move over to GitHub. It's free, its easy, more secure and if anyone needs any old reference of my blog, it will be found here.

Previously, I mentioned that in this new year, I have 3 side-projects that I've been working on. Here they are in brief:

##Project 1: Carpool Brunei (Bebaya)
Hacked an existing freelance app I was building and decided to add the carpool element to it. Just need to change a few nodes here and there and it should be up and running. Hopefully. Some obstacles about this were something in the lines of:

* Can this generate revenue?
* If so, how do I get paid?
* How to ensure users' safety when using and not using it?

Not sure but I know the demand is there, regardlesss. It is currently [in progress](http://carpoolbru.firebaseapp.com).

##Project 2: Brunei Sign Language App (BSLA)
Working along with Anak IT on this one. We got a request to turn their book into an app so its easy for those who have already attended the course to refer back to it without bringing that book along. Honestly, I read through some of it and it was interesting. The most interesting part was the incorporation of Brunei words is now in a specific sign language like *Assalamualaikum, Bismillah, Alhamdulillah* and *Ambuyat*. **LOL!**

I will be building this with [Ionic Framework](http://www.ionicframework.com) for rapid development approach. Basically, importing images and add the ability to search for a few when needed. I suppose I could build the skeleton and add content first and let that be the first alpha version. We'll see.

##Project 3: Algorithm Expert High Frequency Trading (AEHFT)
After several attempts at Expert Advisor building, taking up further courses and learning more materials on how to safely use Expert Advisor to build up the perfect passive income system, I found Machine Learning. I may have mentioned this a few times before but my progress in using it becomes detrimental due to:

* Not enough knowledge in R or Python
* Can't see how to connect a machine to trade for me (or to generate a safer EA?)
* I suck at higher level maths apparently.

Linear Regression, Linear Models, Algebra is a must for this. Still a long way to go.
