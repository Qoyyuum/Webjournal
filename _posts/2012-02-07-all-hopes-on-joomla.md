The last time I used Joomla was a long time ago. And that&#8217;s why my company website was suspended for lack of web activity. Well I can always deal with it later.

But more importantly, I gotta build this freakin web project I&#8217;ve got. More on this later.

But even more importantly, Joomla has been developing faster than the last time I was using it. Last version was 1.6 that I knew about. Now 2.5 was released and I&#8217;m far behind on its changelog.

I&#8217;m so gonna lose my web development skills, I think its about high time I should diverse to a more custom method than installing and downloading extensions and platforms created by others.

sudo apt-get install Joomla-2.5 yadda yadda yadda&#8230;
