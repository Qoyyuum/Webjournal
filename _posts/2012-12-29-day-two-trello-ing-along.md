**Goal 1:** The web project is taking a little bit more form now than before. Though that&#8217;s just the front-end and havn&#8217;t done much or the backend yet. However, in order to keep myself on track and knowing what to do next can now be viewed over at Trello.  
[ManaBelurih Trello Project](https://trello.com/board/manabelurih/50dd11b8cf200c2466000a5a)

That and just in case I don&#8217;t deviate from the project tasks, I use a nifty little web app called Beeminder.

**Goal 2:** Havn&#8217;t done anything for this FX EA Project yet.

**Goal 3:** Still not sure what to do with him.
