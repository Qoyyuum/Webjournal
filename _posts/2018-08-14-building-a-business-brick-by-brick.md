So I'm really happy with myself. I've finally finished building a simple [Borneo Bulletin Downloader](https://github.com/Qoyyuum/bb-dl) script from Bash to Python. There's still a few more other sideprojects but I think I should be focusing on building up my business that would support me while I contribute to more opensource projects. I know I kept saying *I'll build that expert advisor, a trading robot, that would essentially make me thousands per month and then with that income, I'll build another business and make a few more on the side so I don't have all my eggs in one basket, yada yada.*

## Not This Time

This time, I really am going to do it. Now the time has switched to using MQL5 instead of MQL4, I'll go with that. About 3 weeks ago, my wife decided to enter the Forex world. She wanted to try and learn the ropes. When she started off, she was so happy and really wanted to make a lot of money from Forex to supplement her lifestyle. I was happy to see that, honestly. She has yet to learn the problem of every Forex trader. The discipline to continue playing. Forex is a game. Not suppose to just win big and call it quits. It doesn't work that way. Maybe for those who just plays Forex competitions but not the entire Forex lifetime. Its not truly possible to always earn a consistent income from Forex but its impossible to get an earning from Forex. But seeing my wife so glee and happy that she made $0.50 or $1 about a few trades, got me thinking that "I want to feel like that again". The feeling to win.

## But I Know

Winning $1 or so is just not enough. When I entered a trade on my wife's account, to explain and show her how my strategy works, I made $5 that day. And that's from a $20 account. Anyone might be thinking, "Wow! Do 4 more and you can get your money back." Easier said than done unfortunately. Trading is about finding opportunities, optimize wins, manage losses and consistency. She managed to find opportunities but couldn't handle the remaining 3 major lessons of a pro forex trader. When I tried to explain the psychology behind it, to maintain a consistent and optimize win rate and how to handle losing trades, she fazes out. Its boring, yes I know but its important to learn how to overcome those difficulties on your own. She still ignores me after all that and busted the account just a few days ago. Fantastic

## All The More Reason to Automate

This is why I wanted to automate my strategy. So people like her, don't have to trade and learn the ropes. Build a signal, she subscribes, I make money, she makes money. And its a win-win. By automating my trades and I get subscribers, hosting my bot, we all make money, we all win.

To be continued...
