# It&#8217;s an AWESOME SELF-HELP BOOK!

I never thought of actually be reading on my Android tablet to actually be wanting to read a book. But because of my habit of reading online blogs,magazines and newspapers, this one takes the cake! I first discovered this book from a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/148609/how-to-win-friends--influence-people-a-guide" target="_blank">lifehacker article</a>&nbsp;that has a quote typed out by <a href="https://www.google.com.bn/search?q=Dale+Carnegie&oq=Dale+Carnegie&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2184j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Dale Carnegie</a>. That quote lead me to find his ebook on Amazon (as depicted in the image above). I got it, downloaded the ebook, read it and it was amazing. I even applied it to my work and the project just seems easier to deal with. Of course, I had to read it over on my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en" target="_blank">Android Tablet Kindle app</a> to make it work.

**My personal recommendation of this book: 10/10 in the self-development category**
