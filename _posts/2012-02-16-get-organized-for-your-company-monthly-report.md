For some people who are really busy moving from site to site, its hard to keep track of what you did that day and close to the end of the month, you are tasked to write up a monthly report of what you did for the whole month.

**The Problem**  
We are human. We forget stuff. We kinda have ADD. Not many of us remembers what we did last week unless they had it jotted down on some piece of paper.

**The Solution**  
Use [www.ifttt.com](http://www.ifttt.com/) and leverage social channels. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ifttt-tasks.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Using IFTTT to automate web tasks to make my life a whole lot easier." border="0" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ifttt-tasks.png?resize=640%2C320" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

**My Solution**  
I use Foursquare to check-in at places as soon as I get there. And everytime I checked-in, ifttt sends me a gmail of where I was, what I did, and what are my notes at that check-in.

**IFTTT**  
IFTTT stands for **<u>IF</u> <u>T</u>his <u>T</u>hen <u>T</u>hat**. What it does is do an <u>if</u> condition and when it meets <u>this</u> condition, <u>then</u> it does <u>that</u>. Here is an example:

_**IF**_ I publish **_THIS_** blog post on Blogger, _**THEN**_ have it also send **_THAT_** blog post to Facebook.

The channels I used are **Blogger** and **Facebook**.

For my monthly report, it will fill up my **Gmail** with **Foursquare** Check-ins. Then all I have to do is extract my Gmail to an excel sheet. I could string this as another ifttt task like:

**_IF_** I receive a Gmail about **_THIS_** check-in,** _THEN_** have it put into an excel sheet in **_THAT_** Google Docs.

But they don&#8217;t have Google Docs as a channel yet.

I highly recommend my colleagues to use ifttt.com for any part of your work. Life can be easier to cope if you know the right tools to use.
