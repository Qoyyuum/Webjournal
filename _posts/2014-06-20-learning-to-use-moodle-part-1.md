  Setting up my online course is hard
</h2>

<div>
  Normally, that is the case when anyone tries to learn any new technology. Moodle&#8217;s new version (2.5 and above) has made plenty of changes which kind of intrigues me to learn how to use it and leverage it for my academy project.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  So I&#8217;ve been spending some of my time learning at Moodle and part of the open course&#8217;s task was to reflect on what I&#8217;ve learnt about it through some sort of medium (posting it on Facebook/Twitter/blog/vlog about it, etc). I&#8217;ve decide to blog what I&#8217;ve learnt thus far.

## What I&#8217;ve learnt in the 2 week Learn Moodle open course

### Create a Course and Add Learners

<div>
  I have learnt on how to create a course and add learners by registering those students manually and enrolling them in. At least by this method, if students are reluctant to sign-up online, I can sign them up on their behalf.
</div>

### Add or Manage &#8220;Blocks&#8221; on Moodle

<div>
  I have used other Open-Source Content Management systems. Blocks in Moodle is the equivalent of Modules in Joomla or Widgets in WordPress. So its pretty straightforward for me.

### Set up Activities for Students

<div>
  In a traditional training environment, these are learning agendas for the students to follow. If the teachers want them to read a material, we choose a &#8220;Book&#8221; or &#8220;Resource&#8221; activity. If the teachers want them to answer a quiz, we select &#8220;Quiz&#8221; and post up random and relevant questions for the students to answer. Along with the Quiz or any other questioning module/plugin for Moodle, we can add and update a thing called a &#8220;Question Bank&#8221;. So instead of reprinting or re-organizing questions repeatedly for different students or different batch of students, teachers can just keep adding more and more questions to the Question Bank and it loads up on to the quiz where students can answer them as they appear. Pretty neat.
</div>

<div>
  There&#8217;s more to it like Forums for students to interact and work together as a group, or a wiki where every student collaborates on creating a chapter of what they&#8217;ve learnt into their own words. And this is also dependent on what plugins and modules I download from Moodle&#8217;s Plugin Directory.

## Week 1 and Week 2 of Teaching with Moodle Completed

<div>
  Next, I&#8217;ll be learning Week 3 and Week 4. Pretty much zooming and fixing up my online academy as I go. I should be able to learn how to set up grading and assessing students work in developing their web skills.
