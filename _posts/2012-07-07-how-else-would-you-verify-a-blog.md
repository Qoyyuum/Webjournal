Some sites are really odd in trying to verify whether the site belongs to a person. I understand that the only way is to either add a code somewhere or do something onto a blog that people does not normally do. Like adding a badge button, or a link back or even as odd as this token code by Technorati. So here&#8217;s the token verification code:

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">E57DDG8SVRSV</span>  
<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span>  
<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">So Technorati. Wassup? Just sayin&#8217; hey.</span>  
<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span>  
<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><i>Which brings me up to a puzzle. If you were to verify any site, how would you do it?</i></span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There must be a way to verify sites without doing things like these.</span>  
<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><i><br /></i></span>
  


## <span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: large;"><b>Other Suggested Ways to verify a blog site from Technorati by my trail of thoughts:</b></span>

  * <span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Calling the webmaster, who received the email with the special token or code. But then again, anyone could receive it if its forwarded and plus that&#8217;s just towards a person. Not a site.</span>
  * <span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Asking the webmaster to add a special file attached to the site. This is a method from Google to do analytics and using Webmaster tools for a site. This could work but not for Blog owners.</span>
