Hey all, how&#8217;ve you been? Sorry I have been updating this blog as much as I should for all my web discoveries. Been busy with work, y&#8217;know? Anyways, something came up. 

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Several days ago,&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/114086714246304936795" target="_blank">+Nero Le Morte</a>&nbsp;emailed and chatted with me about him learning on web design and development. Similarly, someone else (I don&#8217;t remember who you are but if you&#8217;re reading this, I apologize and please get back to me) who emailed me several months ago requested for the same. So I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221;Maybe more people are in need to learn some of this for their personal use. Like their own blog or online portfolio or online CV.&#8221; So I&#8217;ve decided to restart my academy project to become another non-profit academy project.

## Setting Up My Web Academy

<div>
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/edmodo.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Edmodo - an Educational Platform to share, collaborate and distribute course materials and manage assignments with students." border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/edmodo.jpeg?resize=400%2C192" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  </div>

    <div>
      I&#8217;ve decided to try using <a href="https://www.edmodo.com/" target="_blank">Edmodo</a> again after last year&#8217;s attempt to use it. Before that, I tried to use in concurrent to my tutoring job in 2006. The problem with Edmodo at the time was that it wasn&#8217;t very user-friendly and that my students didn&#8217;t have stable Internet Connection (Curse you, local ISP!!). Even I had trouble using it.

    <div>
      Now in Oct 2013, it looks like Edmodo did very well. I noticed several changes, useful features and maybe even be used to help me get my academy up and running. Though its not definite yet that I&#8217;ll be using Edmodo forever. I might migrate to <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> or build my very own e-learning management system.

    <h3>
      Going Beta
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Just as the blog title mentioned, I&#8217;m setting my academy project to Beta. I&#8217;ve already gotten my course plan setted up last year. I guess its high time I should make my course materials up and available for students to use.
    </p>
    
    <h2>

    <div>
      So at the moment, I&#8217;ll be focusing on the above and maybe, once I get a good foundation, I might expand my web academy further. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
