Got an idea on what to write after so long. I surfed on so many websites and every time I got an idea for a book to write, BAM! There it is, somebody else wrote it. Oh ho, but not today.

After so many months, I already planned out my e-learning and business model. Now to lead up to that is my ebook to encourage the youth to leverage the free-cost benefit of building websites. I&#8217;m already on page 4 with 800 words under 2 hours with custom images of what I&#8217;m writing about.  
My next step: hanging out at a coffee shop with my laptop and finish writing this ebook. Gotta stay focused with less distractions.
