A while ago, I came across a page about computer science. Google has already mentioned that they normally take in candidates that does have Computer Science degrees. So what hope would there be if a person has no Computer Science degree, let alone afford to enroll into one. Enter the <a href="http://www.google.com/edu/tools-and-solutions/guide-for-technical-development/index.html" target="_blank">Guide forÂ Technical Development</a>.

# Computer Science for Everyone

Computer Science is awesome. You get to learn what a lot of programmers have to understand on how a computer computes what instructed to do. Can you even get a job in the ICT industry without one? Sure you can, but with difficulty. In fact, Computer Science has actually becoming more and more essential to the job requirements than before.

Of course, the next step after Computer Science is to take up and learn about a programming language or two. Then, apparently, you would also need to learn about Software Quality Assurance and Testing over at <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs258" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. Later on, the recommendations also mentioned on a strong understanding on Logic, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm" target="_blank">Maths</a>, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2008/index.htm" target="_blank">Algorithms</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures" target="_blank">Data Structures</a> and plenty more.

The recommendation list on having a solid foundation in Computer Science may seem moderate, but the links and resources it provides are actually pretty huge. In my opinion, for a self-study student, this may take up to a year with moderate pacing to learn up.

Personally, I also find the interesting part about the Computer Science is the <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Code Jam</a> module where participants crack the code and may win a prize.
