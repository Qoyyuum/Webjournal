If you knew me, you would know that I spent some of my time over at <a href="https://www.quora.com/Abdul-Qoyyuum-Haji-Abdul-Kadir" target="_blank">Quora</a> and answer questions. I wish I could do the same over at StackOverflow, but hey, I like answering simpler stuff. But the most question I get asked over at Quora was &#8220;**How do you learn to program or code?**&#8221; or &#8220;**Where do you start to learn to build webapps or apps?**&#8220;, etc.

Each and every time I get asked, I looked for my previous answer that I already answered, copied and pasted into the new question. So, just incase I lost that answer somewhere, I&#8217;ll copy it here too.

## **How do you learn to program or code?**

Step 1: Google for resources or documents and courses

Step 2: Practice

Step 3: Help others

&nbsp;

## **Where do you start to learn to build webapps or apps?**

There are lots of these resources online. If I were you, start at <a href="http://bentobox.io" target="_blank">BentoBox</a> and take up the learning track. Straight forward way of becoming a programmer or coder.

Note: I will update this post to be a much more detailed learning path for everyone to start learning programming or coding.
