Back to coding for me again. With the end of 2013, I&#8217;ve decided to at least build something out of my skills for this year. And here comes&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/106066024489704377894" target="_blank">+CodeIgniter</a>

So I went into this little tutorial (premium paid) to learn about how to build a simple to-do webapp out of it. Now if anyone asks me on how to build a basic webapp, I can definitely do it. But if anyone asks me on how to remove the index.php in the URL for CodeIgniter, I would say, &#8220;NOPE!&#8221;

Below, I posted this question over at Google+.   
<!-- Place this tag in your head or just before your close body tag. -->

<!-- Place this tag where you want the widget to render. -->

<div data-href="https://plus.google.com/103307601841731531327/posts/TrbfFv9ywAb">
</div>

Still waiting for an answer and hopefully, be able to make a SEF webapp. (FYI, SEF means Search Engine Friendly.)
