  <a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/killer_panda.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Protect me PANDA!" border="0" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/killer_panda.png?w=676" title="Image from gamebanana.com" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

&#8220;Security&#8221;, &#8220;important files&#8221;, &#8220;virus&#8221;, &#8220;hacks&#8221; and &#8220;blue screens of death (BSOD)&#8221; are the only keywords in my mind that enables me to think, &#8220;Gotta update and/or install an antivirus&#8221;. So I downloaded an open-source video editing application called <a href="http://www.techradar.com/downloads/lightworks" target="_blank">Lightworks</a> (just to try it out), only to find that my Panda (my current virus killer) just terminated it.

My antivirus is called <a href="http://www.cloudantivirus.com/en/" target="_blank">Panda Cloud</a>. And I have mentioned this before and I did ask if anyone has ever tried any other antiviruses to their recommendation. Now when I open up my Panda console and saw this:

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panda-Cloud-Gone-Metro.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Panda gone metro" border="0" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panda-Cloud-Gone-Metro.png?resize=640%2C472" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

The interface changed completely and Panda turned to metro design. Found some interesting features about it.

  * Ability to add more functionalities
  * Added new USB Vaccine (basically USB port defender from Virus coming in through thumb drives)
  * Better look and overview on Scanning progress and virus killer
  * Easier to scan

  I have yet to fully explore what else it can do but I like the new updates.
