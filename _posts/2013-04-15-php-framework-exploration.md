After my recent attempts to just custom build a PHP application, I often wonder how people of the web tries to hack a website. It&#8217;s a nightmare actually. So I scoured the hacking forums and try to find out how they find security holes in a website. And I found the document for it. Now I don&#8217;t think it would be wise if I shared it to everyone so I&#8217;m gonna keep it for my security testing.

This made me realize that my PHP structure may not be at its best. Not with some sensitive contact information that people can easily sell it to and spam them. So hence, the new adventure in my web journal.

## Looking at PHP Frameworks

One google search was all it took to blow me away. Finding out that there&#8217;s so many PHP frameworks out there, I couldn&#8217;t decide which is the best one for my side project. There&#8217;s CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Zend, Symfony, etc. So much for convenience for noobs.

Then I turned to a good ol&#8217; community over at Google Plus. Posted a thread discussion:

## The Decision

I have decided that I will first venture into CodeIgniter. Then if that doesn&#8217;t work, I may move to Symfony and maybe dabble in Laravel. Just for comparison and experience.

It&#8217;s Adventure Time. ðŸ˜‰
