**Goal 1:** Responsive Web Development isn&#8217;t really all that cracked up to be. But then again, if I wanted my people to view my website on their smartphone or tablet then by God, they will have it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but just maybe next month. Freakin&#8217; CSS.

**Goal 2:** I revisited my Forex strategies and maybe perhaps I could restart it and do it on a schedule kind of basis. Thanks to XEMarkets cross-platform capability, I can do the following strategies:  
&#8211; Using Trend lines to identify uptrends, downtrends and ranging. Then trade at different swings.  
&#8211; Using Ichimoku Kinko Hyo to do shorter trades.

Then if I get a good record and portfolio in trading, I will then use that to prove my worth over at etoro.com. And from there, if anyone is interested, they can follow my trades and all of us can share the profits. To be updated.
