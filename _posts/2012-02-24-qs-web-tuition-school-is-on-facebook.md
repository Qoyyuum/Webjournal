In my efforts to educate people in web skills, I have just made a fan page just for the cause. There, I will be making updates to my e-learning projects. I&#8217;m still making the course materials and setting them up on the website.

      <a href="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Qs-Web-Tuition-School-Logo.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="A Quickie design for the Q's Web Tuition School." border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Qs-Web-Tuition-School-Logo.jpg?w=676" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

      The Logo designed in about 10 minutes. A quickie design I guess.

My bigger concern is the payment gateway. I could use Paypal, however being that I&#8217;ll be in Brunei a lot more than anywhere in the world, I have decided to use Skrill (aka the _changed_&nbsp;MoneyBookers). The logo however is just a quick design. I&#8217;m still thinking of something better. Something more usable that I can incorporate into other products and services that I&#8217;ll be developing in the future.

Be sure to follow&nbsp;[Q&#8217;s Web Tuition School Facebook Fan Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Qs-Web-Tuition-School/365906106760544?sk=wall) to keep up with my e-learning updates! Coming soon in Brunei!
