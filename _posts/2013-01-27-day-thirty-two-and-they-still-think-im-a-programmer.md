**Goal 1:** Google Maps API is so hard. Now that I&#8217;m just playing pinpoint on locations on the map I have to re-study what I&#8217;ve learnt in school about latitudes and longitudes. I used to like Math until I took an arrow to the knee at 45 Degree angle with a velocity of over **9000**.

**Goal 2:** Still working on it. Found a nice little labelling expert script in the MQL community. [Elliot Waves labels &#8211; MQL4 Code Base](http://codebase.mql4.com/8513) The Elliot Wave Strategy isn&#8217;t always accurate especially when you have to deal with a ranging market (I hate those situations). But if I mix this with Fibonacci, I might pull off a stable expert advisor. So I guess I have 2 idea systems here.

**System 1:** Ichimoku Kinko Hyo + 2 RSIs (RSI 2 & RSI 12). Determine the price reversals across 30min, 1 hr, 4hr, weekly & monthly, then trade. Usually works with USDJPY but I might back test this with another currency.

**System 2:** Use Elliot Wave&#8217;s Concept + Trendline (or an intelligent way of counting bars for highest high + lowest high / lowest low + highest low over a span of #) + Elliot Wave Labelling Expert. Find the breakout (or price reversal), trade and take profit or stop loss.

I&#8217;m setting a standard to take profit at 30 pips. I might dabble that afterwards as part of the expert options along with System 2&#8217;s span #.
