If you have met me or knew me enough, you would have already known that I casually play Capture The Flag games. No, not the kind where we have to run to the enemy's base, get the flag and run back while not getting hit by Nerf bullets. I'm talking about the cyber version of capture the flag games where we analyse, hack, and exploit to get a flag that's a literal string word, and not an object. Something like `CBCTF{some_h4X0r_sTr!nG}`. Once we get the flag, we're supposed to use that to answer the questions provided by the scoring web server.

I realized I didn't blog about it but way back in 2015 was my first Capture The Flag game. I had no clue what I was doing but I was so damn interested in knowing more about it. It was also the first Cyber Battle Capture The Flag game in Brunei too. Then the next following year, I joined again and won 2nd place. It was neat. After that, my team just started switching up and down and wasn't really consistent in getting better team members to win more games. Even then, play online games.

But just yesterday, I managed to join a team, played the qualifiers, scored 5 questions and get ranked 13/17 teams. Not exactly impressive but in comparison to this year's qualifying round vs last year's, this was more fun with the questions. Either I got better or the questions got easier. In fact, it was so much fun, [I did a write up of how I got the flags](https://github.com/Qoyyuum/CBCTF2018Qualifiers). Even though, my team and I didn't get in the finals, we all had fun.

I would love to keep playing these games for prizes or for the awareness and knowledge in IT security, but I got responsibilities. We'll see if I can find more time to spare and maybe try and win some online international games and not just local ones.

In the meantime, I'll just play them casually as and when the opportunity arises.
