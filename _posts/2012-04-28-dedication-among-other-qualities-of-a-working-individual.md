Part of getting things done, I am practically swamped by other matters in life. A normal day job, a side-project or two, my love life, my family life and my personal life. If time can be managed I would have reached my goals by now.

Some project updates, I have been working hard on them CSS design for my web app. Considering the whole project is gonna be in python that is surrounding the HTML with the allowed CSS, might as well design it first. Project Repitcher, Project SMS and Project Q&#8217;s Web Academy are going on schedule. Still developing content, and studying them through Udacity&#8217;s course and other sites.

While all of this product and service development is going on, Fx has been doing OK for me. Its still trading and still moving on a daily chart. Havn&#8217;t exactly moved to the exit point yet but it&#8217;s gonna get there no worries.

Bottomline: Need more focus&#8230;
