That is a smart

Answer by Carlos Del Carpio:
  


> The founder of Dropbox was pitching in front of an investor one day, and the investor asked him: "there are similar companies out there doing the same as dropbox, why should I invest in just another similar company?"</p> 
> 
> His reply: "Yes. There are similar companies out there doing the same as dropbox. But do you use any of them?"
> 
> "No."
> 
> "Why?"
> 
> "Because they are bad."
> 
> "Ok. That's what Dropbox wants to solve."
> 
> So bottomline: **Ask your potential customers**.
> 
> Any business idea is a solution to someone's problem out there. Ask them if they are solving it, how they are solving it, and if they would be willing to pay to have it solved.
> 
> It doesn't matter if it already exists if it can be done better.
