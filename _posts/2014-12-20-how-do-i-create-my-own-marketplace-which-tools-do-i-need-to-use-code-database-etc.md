> There are, from where I am sitting at this question, 2 ways to approach this:</p> 
> 
> The Easy Way &#8211; Using any established CMS platform and then just install a marketplace component or a published marketplace script available and install that. It's just a matter of sourcing which platform or script match your needs.

> **<u>Easy Way of Doing it</u>** 
> 
>   1. Install WordPress
>   2. Install a Marketplace Plugin
>   3. Configure the settings
>   4. Run
> 
> OR 
> 
>   1. Install Joomla
>   2. Install a Marketplace Plugin
>   3. Configure the settings
>   4. Run
> 
> Etc if you look at other platforms
> 
> The Hard Way &#8211; Develop everything from scratch using any form of language as your base. _My preference_ is using **HTML5 + CSS Library (Twitter Bootstrap) + AngularJS + FireBase**.

>   1. Where HTML5 structures and markup where things should be. 
>   2. Twitter Bootstrap helps with the easy styling (at first, I would keep everything to default color scheme and then later, tweak the design to meet the functions). 
>   3. AngularJS to create the interactivity &#8211; i.e. Create new product entry, create a chat channel, add sellers account, add buyers account, etc. 
>   4. Firebase would be my preferred database as a developer.</blockquote>
