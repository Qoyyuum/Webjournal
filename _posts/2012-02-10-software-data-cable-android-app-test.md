Lifehacker just released an article about a new Android app called &#8220;Software Data Cable&#8221;. The irony to the app name is that its supposed to allow my Android phone to connect to my laptop or desktop PC wirelessly. So I can transfer files, sync my contacts/calendars/music/pictures, and probably more.

So I downloaded this app and see how it goes. I don&#8217;t think its possible but I really hope this app can also charge up my phone wirelessly. _Until my next post&#8230;_

So this doesn&#8217;t work now. Considering how old this post is but I do have something much more recent for this type of dilemma and that is, PushBullet and Airdroid.

You can find a full article on the 2 fantastic Android apps for easily transferring files over WiFi at another Blog that I contribute my articles to: <a href="http://blog.anak.it/2014/06/how-to-receive-mobile-notifications-on.html" target="_blank">How To Receive Mobile Notifications on PC?</a>
