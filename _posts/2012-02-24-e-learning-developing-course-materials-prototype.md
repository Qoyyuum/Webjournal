I&#8217;ve asked this around and my feedback were little. Don&#8217;t know why but at least there&#8217;s feedback regardless. Here&#8217;s a prototype course I&#8217;ve been working on. Its about how to make money blogging. My learning experience since 2009 should not go to waste so I&#8217;ve decided to make a paid course about it. It&#8217;s probably cheap. Probably. <strike>Below is just a sample. Have a look-see. </strike>Update: It was a presentation preview from Google Docs. Because of the move from Google Docs to Google Drive, its no longer available. And because I&#8217;m working on it, I&#8217;ve taken it off of my drive account and into a different cloud app. Possibly Dropbox, specifically for e-learning purposes.
