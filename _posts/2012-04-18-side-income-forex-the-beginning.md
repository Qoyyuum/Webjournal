  It has been about 5 years now that I have been learning how to use Forex, its indicators, charts, tools and its fundamentals to analyze every single tick/pip/candle.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Now that I got this far using several demo accounts, I’m ready to take on a broker to handle my trades. I’ve decided to use Trading Point and apply for an Islamic account.

  <p>
    I have an EA ready and set up to help me analyze my charts instantly and I’ll trade by then.
