I was working on these tutorials (published somewhere around the net) of variety of subjects. And I did them mostly over on MS Word. Other times, it’s on a notepad.

So it came to a wonder, if I wanted to publish my written work over on my personal website, it can be of either 2 ways:

  1. Re-write it up and add HTML codes around the documents. Extract the images and place them in the images folder.&nbsp;
  2. Put the word document into an iframe.

So I have this thought. Instead of copying and pasting or converting a word document to a web page, why don’t I just add it in and viewed in an iframe instead?

<iframe width = “75%” height= “55%” name= “fframe” src= “QsTutorial.docx”></iframe>

Of course, if one were to view such files, they must download the MS Word plug-in to see the word document. That’s one disadvantage. Perhaps there’s one file format that browsers may accept but I’ll have to look into it. I’m gonna try this out at my online dev site.

_Hmmm…._
