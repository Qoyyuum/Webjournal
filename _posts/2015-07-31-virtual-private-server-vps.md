As a web developer, we play with servers a lot. I mean, really a lot. From transferring files, synchronizing them, sharing them with our teammates, maintaining a database in a server, creating services, securing the backend of the server through ports, etc. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that we need a physical server. We could use a Virtual Private Server (or &#8220;_VPS_&#8221; for short).

# Why have a VPS?

VPS is nice to have as opposed to owning a physical server. Sure, with a physical server, you get to touch the hardware part. Make your own upgrades, customize the server rack, network ports, and so forth. But if you don&#8217;t want to deal with the hardware part of the server and just want to get started to develop whatever software/application/file sharing utilities you want, go virtual instead.

## Owning a Server VS Paying a Subscription for a Server

That&#8217;s right. Owning a server is like owning another machine at your disposal. It&#8217;s another added asset. However, just like any devices, it needs maintenance. Like a house or a car. You have to maintain the space that the physical server is in, the power that its running maintained and not getting cut off from some freak lightning storm, the overheating problem, etc. But you don&#8217;t have to deal with all of that if you went for a server for rent. And these types of servers are available as a VPS.  There&#8217;s a huge cost difference in getting a server from owning and subscription. With a subscription, the cost for starting a server is very cheap and affordable. I would prefer having a VPS instead, as it also saves me the bandwidth and data quota of the Internet usage and the hard work in maintaining the server is kept alive at all times by server experts.

There are several VPS services online that does this as a service. And out of most of them, I went and chose to use <a class="thirstylink" href="http://blog.qoyyuum.me/endorses/vpshost/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HostWinds</a>.

## My Experience with a dedicated VPS

May not be the cheapest but it is the most affordable and worth while having. Their tech support is very top-notch. <a class="thirstylink" href="http://blog.qoyyuum.me/endorses/vpshost/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HostWinds</a> has both Linux and Windows VPS options available. I got one with a **Windows Server 2012 Edition** at **Tier 1**  (that&#8217;s $13.50/month) and that in itself is cool to have. There are also plenty of add-ons that make this feel more like an on-a-budget server such as **upgrading RAM**, **adding more disk space**, **CPU cores** and much more. I bought a VPS as a way for me to play around with SQL Server Databases like what I normally do at work.

If interested in having a VPS of your own, you can use HostWinds and then use this coupon &#8220;**QUICKVPS**&#8221; to get 25% discount on any VPS subscription off of their payment plan.
