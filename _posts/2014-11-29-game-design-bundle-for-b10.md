I have always wanted to build my own Game Development Team. Problem was that when I go around asking for who wants in and build games, others are either too busy (they have a full-time job, I understand that), and others don&#8217;t have the technical skills to make stuff. But guess what &#8220;technically-lacking people&#8221;, you get to learn game design and development for as little as BND$10!
