Hmm&#8230; $94 in a day trade&#8230; I would earn a little more if I have a larger deposit. So far I have seen the pattern and I can now be certain that in and every trade (and I do try to keep it as short as possible on hourly and 4 hourly charts), I can earn decently&#8230; I lost a couple of trades yesterday and it was a good thing it wasn&#8217;t that bad.

My mistake was being a little careless of watching the signals and its indicators. One of my next project is to turn this into an EA.

Indicators used:

  1. Stoch (5,3,3)
  2. RSI (7)
  3. RSI (12) and RSI (2)
  4. Moving Average (Period 14, Shift 0)

  I should try add another strategy cluster to this.
