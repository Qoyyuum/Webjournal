For several months, I have been practicing lucid dreaming. Its a really nice experience. Being able to control your own world, change the outcome to what you want. Like a slice of heaven.

The only catch is, you will feel it in the morning&#8230; like 1:00am.

However, I didn&#8217;t actually do this every night. Sometimes, I just let my dreams take me wherever my subconscious can lead me. You could consider me a seasoned lucid dreamer.

_What&#8217;s your take on lucid dreaming?_

For those who havn&#8217;t tried lucid dreaming, I would say its a wonderful experience but it requires a lot of practice. [Click this link to learn how.](http://www.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream)
