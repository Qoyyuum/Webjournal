Project SMS Plan is in effect.

After some planning and idea forming, I may be able to create the next best thing for Brunei anonymous sellers. Perhaps something that would benefit all businesses too.

The idea is to send an SMS everytime a user has a problem with a website. This SMS will also send a copy to the company email. Here is an example:

> Siti goes into mylilshop.blogspot.com and found a cool product that she wants to buy. Maybe shoes, in this case. She places her order through the form (whatever they use, Google Docs/Form builders, etc). After sending the product order, the shop owner, Aziz, receives an SMS on their phone that a product has been placed.

So in a sense of e-commerce, this could benefit all of Brunei. But more importantly, I should be able to put this into my own practice. And with a little help from PRIMA, I might be able to make certain commands receive from phone to PC. An example: 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0387.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The SMS plan. This might be able to work with my Project SMS. I just hope its not a dead idea." border="0" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0387.jpg?resize=241%2C320" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

> I wanna run my utorrent client when I tried to remote in from utorrent&#8217;s web. All I have to do is send the following command: `cmd open utorrent.exe`  
> Then I should be able to have utorrent running from my desktop and my laptop will be able to control torrents remotely. </p>
&nbsp;Now I just need to subscribe to PRIMA and see the next step&#8230;
