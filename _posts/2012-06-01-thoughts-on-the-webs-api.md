      I have been looking at a lot of these APIs and if I write them down somewhere to take note, might as well write it as a blog post. So here are some of the apps and my thoughts on what I can do with them with my projects:
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/"><b>Twitter API</b></a> â€“ Just like anything else, login with Twitter, Tweet articles, etc. My only look at this is for marketing purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/"><b>Facebook API</b></a> â€“ Considering that thereâ€™s the timeline API which was released sometime ago, I might use this to enable the entrepreneur to signal other like-minded entrepreneurs to collaborate while using my web app; Project DuitBrunei/BruneianDollar. Also, login with Facebook to be made along with marketing tactics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/"><b>LinkedIn API</b></a> â€“ Login with Linkedin should be the most preferred for Project DuitBrunei/BruneianDollar. Also, possibly, allow users to post their business plan executive summary and investment plan to itâ€™s linkedin group as soon as they make their plan public. <i>The possibilities.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers">DropBox API</a> </b>â€“ Project DuitBrunei/BruneianDollar will be using DropBoxâ€¦ A lot! Simply because I donâ€™t wanna store any of the userâ€™s data on my web app. Itâ€™s their data, they have the right to keep it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://angel.co/api"><b>AngelList API</b></a>&nbsp;â€“ Perhaps at the same time of publishing their plan to LinkedIn, they could also post it to AngelList. Thus, doubling their chances for an investment offer from a potential (perhaps, private) investor.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      A play-by-play for all of these APIs could be a strain on my head. But as I re-read this post, I think I have it planned out. Gotta add it to my mindmap at <a href="http://www.mindjet.com/">Mindjet</a>. Oh and I shouldn&#8217;t forget <a href="https://developers.google.com/">ol&#8217; Google Code</a> to help port this web app to the Chrome Web Store. ðŸ˜‰
