# Build a Webapp with Friends is now on SlideShare

Some of you may know that I am also a member of Anak IT. Several months ago, we conducted a one-day workshop to teach IT enthusiasts (mostly technical students) to learn how to build a webapp while at the same time learn how to debug, fix their own mistakes and collaborate with their colleagues if they got stuck. We received a huge reception on this workshop and clearly there&#8217;s more demand for more students and/or enthusiasts to learn further on this.

Without further ado, here were my slides on the matter.

Do keep mind that this was a long time ago, technology may have changed since then.
