I would like to apologize that I hadn&#8217;t come here as often as I should to update my journal. I blame my ISP&#8217;s [sarcasm]super fast and stable Internet Connection.[/sarcasm]

**Goal 1:** After finishing up my website, I did some A/B testing. Apparently the Google Maps API doesn&#8217;t work for my country, Brunei. Crap. Looking up on forums or Q&A sites to help me find what I can do to get the locations set in the maps to be more accurate.

**Goal 2:** I didn&#8217;t win the auction a couple weeks ago. Simply because I didn&#8217;t meet the &#8220;reserve bid&#8221; price over at <a href="http://flippa.com/" target="_blank">http://flippa.com/</a> . And here I thought I could win it cheap. Moving on. I have decided to be thoroughly clear about the system that I&#8217;m building. By looking at some of the simple strategies, testing each one, see the drawdown and how many trades it can go. I found loads of these strategies at Forex Forum sites like <a href="http://forex-strategies-revealed.com/simple" target="_blank">Simple strategies | Forex Strategies & Systems Revealed </a>and <a href="http://www.earnforex.com/" target="_blank">Forex Trading Information, Learn About Forex Trading</a> . However, this may take a couple of weeks to accomplish or get anywhere close to the perfect system that I wanted. To the <a href="http://codebase.mql4.com/" target="_blank">CodeBase</a>!
