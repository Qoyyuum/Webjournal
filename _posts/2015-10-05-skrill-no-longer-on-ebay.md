I didn&#8217;t see this in my bulk of an inbox email and this one, specifically went into my spam box.

A long time ago, I had a dream that Bruneians would join the eBay marketplace with the help of Skrill. Now that the payment option is gone, we&#8217;re back to a digital auction-less country once again. Sigh.

But that doesn&#8217;t mean I am going to give up. I am still on the web adventure to look for an alternative to Skrill as a payment gateway that everyone can enjoy, and still be compliant to earn money and an alternative to make money online. I mean, even <a href="http://bt.com.bn/business-national/2015/10/05/young-bruneians-need-alternative-retirement-plan" target="_blank">this news just showed up today</a> and I don&#8217;t know what to make of it for our future younger generation.

Best of luck, I guess.
