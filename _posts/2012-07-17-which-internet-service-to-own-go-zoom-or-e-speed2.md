Today, after work, I got home only to find my Internet wifi wasn&#8217;t sending me back data packets. Lost some opportunity trades in Forex (Damn you Internet). Tried to reconnect, but I couldn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t know why. I switched from E-speed to Go! Broadband. Saw the speed of the data packets coming in. Really, really slow (over 4000ms). Let it run and get some data updates from the FX History Data Bank while I fix the e-speed problem.

Went down to the modem and routers. Switched it off, felt that the router is SUPER HOT, ate an apple, switched it back on. Went to my room, changed connection from Wifi to Wired Connection (i.e. from Go! to E-speed back again) on my desktop.

Data pings faster than before. Hence, TelBru is faster than DST.

For B.Mobile&#8217;s Zoom! Broadband, went out, borrowed a friend&#8217;s, used his Internet speed. Pings are just as fast as DST&#8217;s sometimes. Then realize that this is just comparable by sites (whereby, some cell sectors can be faster than other cell sectors), so speed varies by that main factor.

## **In Conclusion**

TelBru is the fastest Internet in Brunei. But by my experience, still a lot slower than UK&#8217;s. Sigh.
