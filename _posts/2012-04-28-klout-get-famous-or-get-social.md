[Klout](http://www.klout.com/) is another interesting application. It analyzes your web activity and see if you are the &#8220;Influencer&#8221; or the &#8220;Influenced&#8221;. I was asked that question once 3 years ago. I answered, &#8220;Neither.&#8221; But I forgot why.

Basically, its just a place to analyze your social web score. Nothing else to do. But its pretty cool that it can be put into numbers to see a report of how well you can socialize over the Internet." border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/klout.png?resize=640%2C299" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

I did sign up for Klout 2 years ago under another name with the belief that it could help generate me some side-income. I believed wrong. Now I use it for fun under my personal account. The results are interesting though. Mind-boggling, nay. **Mind-BLASTING!** Didn&#8217;t think I would have influenced more than 20 people personally. So my thoughts on using Klout to anyone, &#8220;Meh&#8221;. But I would sign up just to get those free business cards from [Moo.com](http://moo.com/) as a perk. Then after that, leave it alone I guess.
