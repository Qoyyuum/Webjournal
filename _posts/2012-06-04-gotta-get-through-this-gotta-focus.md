I got two projects to focus on. Cannot deviate. Cannot lose it. I had 2 red bulls and I think Iâ€™m losing it. Project EA and Project DuitBrunei.

[<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Project EA and Project DuitBrunei" border="0" alt="Project EA and Project DuitBrunei. It's tough to multi-task and I'm working on it alone with the occasional help from online forums and social networks but its not enough. Gotta work fast, gotta get them done. No time to lose." src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/multi-project_thumb-25255B8-25255D.png?resize=676%2C183" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/multi-project_thumb-25255B8-25255D.png)

My next task for Project EA; Find the order control formula. My next task for Project DuitBrunei; Finish the 9 page forms. Gotta keep tabs on my progress here.
