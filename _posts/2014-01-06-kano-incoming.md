  I&#8217;ve already ordered a few things online in the past and this is just getting ridiculous at how slow the deliveries are in this country. Though I really do understand that for sake of security, they have to check each individual items going through customs are safe for the country. But I really just can&#8217;t wait for <a href="http://kano.me/" target="_blank">Kano</a> to arrive.
