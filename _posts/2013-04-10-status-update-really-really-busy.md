So its been a really long while since I last updated my blog. Simply because I hardly have time to write. And when I did have time, I don&#8217;t know what to write about. So if any of you readers are wondering what&#8217;s with the really long gap between this post and the previous, this is what has been done during the blog silence:

## 1. Really looking into re-learning Javascript and SQL connection

You might think its odd but because of some articles I read floating around the net, it makes me believe that the web folks have become more intimidating towards other websites. I&#8217;m talking about hacking websites. The current method that I know of Javascripting to SQL connection (storing all of that on a PHP page) made me really scared that it might happen to me. So I gotta step up my game and update myself in creating a more secured web app that I&#8217;ve been working on. That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m still building Project ManaBelurih.

## 2. Updating my web knowledge

What I mean is that some parts of the Internet has changed so much that I can hardly keep up. Aside from the many memes, there&#8217;s also different frameworks to explore into. I might just write up an article on these frameworks and how well its been used. Will probably show a little fun part of using these frameworks with jsFiddle. <img src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=676" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" />

## 3. Stopping different revenue streams to focus on one goal

Previously, I set up 3 goals. 32 days since the goals have been established, I was doing well in my development, except for one. Getting my bro active and making money with him. So to update, I&#8217;m stopping my Forex system build until I finish my Project ManaBelurih. Why? Because of #Brunei Internet. Need I say more? OK, this is how I see it.

ManaBelurih is a web app that provides a platform to find products in Brunei. Once its built, I don&#8217;t have much to do to it until I decide to monetize the platform.

Forex System is well, an automatic bot that makes money while I&#8217;m away from the PC.

The difference between the two is that Forex System requires my PC to stay online. But ManaBelurih requires a web hosting provider to stay online. The web hosting provider will always have Internet. I do not. Hence, my focus on ManaBelurih comes first and then my Fx system will soon come after.

## 4. Joined&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/100392579914024957653" target="_blank">+Anak IT Brunei</a>&nbsp;

Anak IT is just a little charity organisation founded by Zul and&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/102507665210129152921" target="_blank">+Abd Wafiy Haji Mohammad</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and a few others. Their cause to share IT knowledge with the locals is noble. I&#8217;d love to share my knowledge and learn from others. Quite possibly in the hardware area (because I don&#8217;t usually do hardware). Looking forward to be involved in their future. Educating the locals to be more IT Savvy. <img src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=676" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" />

That&#8217;s just about it. So in the coming months, you might not see a lot of my blog posts but I do hope to keep blogging to bookmark my web knowledge to this blog. Until then, surf safe while on the net.
