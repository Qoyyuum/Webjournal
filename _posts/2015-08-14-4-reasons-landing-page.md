Websites are cool but they are not the &#8220;in&#8221; thing at the moment. The advises you might hear from lean startups and businesses is to get a **Minimum Viable Product** (aka _MVP_) up and running and get customers as soon as possible. And to achieve this, you would need a landing page. Here are reasons why:<!--more-->

## One Web Page Is Simpler to Make Than 10&#8217;s or 1000&#8217;s.

A landing page is that. A single web page. Not a whole website. Thus, not a lot of time spent on building one. In fact, it can be done in less than an hour for a web developer expert (like [me](http://blog.qoyyuum.me/about-me-build-website/) ;D ).

## A Landing Page is all you need to generate leads or make sales.

You don&#8217;t send your customers to all of your website pages like your About Us page, your Privacy Policy Page, your many-multiple sub-pages, etc. You send your customers to your sales page. The page that will show the offer and convert the potential customer into a paying customer. That&#8217;s it. Those other extra pages, are just for show and maybe to gain trust but that&#8217;s all it can do for you.

## You will save Time & Money while making more Money & Time for marketing

Like I said in point #1, building a landing page doesn&#8217;t take a lot of time to build. All you need is the offer and an action item for the customer to take. And because it is so quick to develop, you can then move straight into marketing. Advertising that single landing page across social media, social network and through contacts.

## Less Time for Customers to confirmed buyers

Definitely it will take a lot less time for customers to convert into buyers. They click your link, they see your offer page. They see a buy button, they click it. They make the purchase and you got yourself a customer in less than 5 minutes. And that is a fantastic user experience. And since you congested all of that info into one page, the customer doesn&#8217;t have to think about where else to click but the &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; or &#8220;Order Now&#8221; button (aka &#8220;Call-to-Action&#8221;). This also reduces the amount of confusion between your customer and the landing page.

## Conclusion

Quick and simple, a landing page is all a starting business needs to get customers and it takes a lot less time to develop. Over time, businesses can then add on FAQ page, Privacy Policy page, Terms of Service page, etc. Websites can evolve from a single landing page offer, and into a full-blown, feature-rich, website later on.
