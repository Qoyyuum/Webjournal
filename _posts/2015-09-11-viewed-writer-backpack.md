So I just checked <a href="http://www.quora.com" target="_blank">Quora</a> and found a couple of notifications:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-711" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-notif.png?fit=552%2C258" alt="I received a couple of quora notifications" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-notif.png?resize=300%2C140 300w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-notif.png?w=552 552w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-notif.png)

Then I found something weird about it but &#8220;Backpack&#8221;? Must be that question I wrote about what I stuff in my bag daily.

And guess what? I&#8217;m 6th of the 10 Most Viewed Writers in Backpack! Woohoo!

## The Question

If you are wondering what it was, the question was

> <span style="font-size: 18pt;">&#8220;<a href="http://www.quora.com/Abdul-Qoyyuum-Haji-Abdul-Kadir/answers/Backpacks" target="_blank">What does a programmer need or carry in his or her bookbag?</a>&#8220;</span>

## My Answer

<!--more-->

> ### For the most obvious:
> 
>   * A laptop
>   * A power adapter
>   * A mouse
> 
> ### For the not-so obvious:
> 
>   * A pendrive (for smaller transfers)
>   * An external harddrive (for bigger transfers)
>   * An extra keyboard (Personal preference. I prefer typing on a solid keyboard as my wrist on the table feels better than the one on the laptop.)
>   * A Powerbank (the one that can charge my laptop as well)
>   * A notebook with a pen holder (to scribble my ideas and how the databases should interface with each other or to draft logic and algorithms on paper)
>   * Headphones or equivalent (I like to focus on my work and to listen to my own beats is way better than listening to office gossip).
> 
> ### Bonus things to have:
> 
>   * Mobile WiFi (For those who doesn&#8217;t wanna share the office bandwidth, this is a nice advantage, especially if you need to download that nice add-on script without the office blocking your network).
>   * Laptop stand (For ergonomic use, keeping the laptop up to your eye level, so you can sit straight.)
>   * Organizer (To organize all of these gizmos into your bag and not get frustrated when you gotta pull a cable tangled with other cables).
>   * Extra monitors (Seriously, I would love to view my code and see the preview as I design the page, side-by-side. There are a couple of inventions that made this but a little out of my budget).
> 
> For the bag itself, it&#8217;s not called a bookbag, but a messenger bag.

You can <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-does-a-programmer-need-or-carry-in-his-or-her-bookbag" target="_blank">view it here and see other answers to the same question</a>.

On a related note, I have been eyeing myself for [this cool tech bag](http://blog.qoyyuum.me/pack-gadgets-safe-pacsafe-z400/)Â as my new backpack that I would love owning one for.

So I&#8217;m curious as to what others put in their backpack/bookbag/messenger bag/tech bag/etc. Leave it in the comment section!
