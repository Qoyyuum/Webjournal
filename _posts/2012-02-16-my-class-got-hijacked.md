In 2007, I had a job as a tutor. I taught several subjects back in those days; Mathematics, Combined Science, Biology, Chemistry, English. Never took the Malay subject because well, you know.

But as I tutor or teach, there&#8217;s one thing I really don&#8217;t like in my class. _**Getting Interrupted**_. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll express it in this rage comic I&#8217;ve just made.
