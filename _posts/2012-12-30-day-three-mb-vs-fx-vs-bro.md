** **Goal 1:** Part of this web project is so that I can leverage the money made from other businesses. Since its a product search engine and all. But before I do so, I have created a nice little format to hold their contact details to be displayed. Each business registration for verification is free. But what comes after is the opportunity to allow their business to receive online payments. This will probably kill my local online shopping giant (qqestore) and its competitor but, they gotta deal with it.

Database development is nearly done. I just need it to be imported to MySQL and then I can focus on the front-end. Here comes PHP and Twitter Bootstrap.

**Goal 2:** Instead of making one, I found a nice little website that goes along with an EA. The EA costs only USD $67 but I&#8217;m not sure if it works or not. However, I&#8217;m gonna buy the website too. Costs $5000 but I don&#8217;t have the money yet. So instead, I am bidding for it. That&#8217;s right. He&#8217;s auctioning it off! The auction ends somewhere next month. So till then, I can focus on Goal No. 1.

**Goal 3:** Gave up. Moving on.
