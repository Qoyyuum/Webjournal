I&#8217;m only making this switch because I&#8217;ve already set up the local web development environment in the virtualbox. Setting it up on my laptop is taking a lot of my time. Error after error, it just won&#8217;t work. I did exactly how I did on the virtualbox but somehow I&#8217;m not getting the same result. I guess by Einstein&#8217;s definition of insanity, it&#8217;s this:
  


> Repeating the same actions over and over to expect a different result is Insanity.</p>
I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised.

It is dangerously close to 1am and the site is only half-way done. All I need are:

  * To put some lorem ipsum in Chinese, Arabic, English and Malay.
  * Enable a social element for the entrepreneurs
  * Admin-type level for embassies of respective niche\` (or country)

<div>
  And it can be considered done.
