# Who am I?

From time to time, I catch myself asking me this question and I kept getting different answers. `whoami` command in Linux is pretty straightforward.

```
$ whoami
cas-qoyyuum
```

It gives the same answer everytime. Why do I get different answers to myself each time I ask who I am?

## Previous Answers

My last answer was that I was who I was supposed to be. A father, a husband, a good employee who gets the job done, a somewhat below average football player, and a hobbyist coder that is passionate to do great things. And that was a couple of years ago. What about now?

Even though I got this great new job, my son is growing up and my love for my wife reciprocates, I still have identity issues. Some would use past achievements to help dictate who we are and who we are going to be if we keep moving forward.

## What's blocking me?

Until now, a wonder struck me that I might be having an [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) affect. I'm not sure but I do feel like I may have achieved those things in the past either on my own or with some help but it doesn't feel geniune. Codes that I claimed that I built in the apps for a hackathon or that one or two mobile apps I generated were simply copied and twisted to submit. None of that was part of me, except for the idea that I wanted to achieve. The whole thing that I've been doing is quite lazy.

Emotional aside, logically, I would have been able to move forward and say "Objective completed" and see if I'm able to learn, despite the lazy copy & pasta code. In which I did learn what I copied. In fact, I was inspired by monkeys. The whole idea of *Monkey See, Monkey Do* does help entertain the notion of how I can go through life and understand myself further by being smarter. By seeing what others are doing, I copy and learn how to repeat those actions. A real visual learner. But as time goes by, it made me realize if it were still "*me*" that made it happen? I may overthinking this. For instance, a master foreman teaches me how to operate a heavy machinery in a factory by showing me the buttons and switches and in what order do I press and pull to achieve a common objective. Does it mean that I did the job?

Another way of looking at this is that I'm beginning to accept that *winning* and *losing* is just an *illusion*. A clever deception as to keep us impressed and entertained to what life has for us. Am I amused? Yes! But does it define me? I don't know. I mean a chair is a chair, people are people, and we have ways to define things but there are things unexplainable. Like defining the taste of chicken to a vegan for one. Does this mean that our unique identity is also considered as unexplainable? What makes me *me*? What makes anyone *anyone*?
