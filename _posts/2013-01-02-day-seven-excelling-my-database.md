**Goal 1:** So importing MS Excel to Access and then export to .csv format and then import to MySQL was a B*tch! But at least thanks to MS Access, I got the relationship links between tables working. Moving on to the front-end development. A couple of pages down and then PHP work. Might see this up and working by next week or so.

**Goal 2:** Still waiting on winning the auction.
