  It&#8217;s November! And I&#8217;ve decded to take on 2 goals that goes along with my web adventures.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  No Shave November
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  That&#8217;s right. I won&#8217;t be shaving or cutting my hair or beard or moustache anytime for this month. At least I save $20 from this month&#8217;s expenses. So why am I participating? Just because. No reason really.

  Every year, on the month of November, internationally, every author, writer or would-be typists would join and take the challenge. Write a novel for 30 days! I am taking up that challenge because to me, writing a novel is like what I do at work. And what normal people call a novel is that it has a very long, emotionally captured storyline with either lots of characters or lots of events that&#8217;s happening around a certain protagonist(s). Then lastly, an ending.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Well, I&#8217;m writing a Sci-Fi Novel based around a person who lives on the Internet. The ending is tragic but I will not release any details after that. And I call this novel, &#8220;Spider Code&#8221;.
