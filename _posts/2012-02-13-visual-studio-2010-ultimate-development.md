With so many tools out there to build web applications, Visual Studio should be able to speed up my work. Dreamweaver was awesome but its not as practical as Visual Studio in database manipulation. However, if I combine the two, I might be able to create a tasteful <u>and</u>&nbsp;useful app. Now I just gotta know how to use this thing. Anyone free to teach me how to use Visual Studio? Perhaps just to cover the basics would suffice.
