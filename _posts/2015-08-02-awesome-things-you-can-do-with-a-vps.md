Earlier, I posted about [what a VPS is](http://blog.qoyyuum.me/virtual-private-server-vps/). Now let me show you what it can do for you other than web development. There is a wide variety of web applications, softwares, bots, and much more. Here are some of the things that you can do with having a VPS and having fun with it! Note: I am talking about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Windows VPS</strong></span>, not _Linux_.

## Web Development

Like I said before, a lot of us geeks would use servers for actual web development. As a hobby or for work. We store our files there, we host it, we share files and get more coding work done. We could employ the use of Git but that requires us having our repository uploaded to GitHub. So instead we went with **<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank">Mercurial</a>**, a free open-source alternative to git, and whatever source code we commit, it goes into the VPS as our new web server and host. It&#8217;s got versioning, code management and everything!

## Be a Hipster and Run Your Own Dropbox

Or any other cloud drives, for that matter. Why have a Dropbox/Google Drive/OneDrive/etc that has limited amount of space and functionality, when you can own a server with even more spaces and features! For this, the better alternative is to use **<a href="https://owncloud.org/" target="_blank">ownCloud</a>**. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s easy to set up, no mess, no fuss!

## Host a Multiplayer Gaming Server

Ever wanted to play with friends on a game like Minecraft? That&#8217;s what a VPS is for! Have it running 24/7 and let everyone join in a game or two, whenever they like. Setting this up varies in different games, so look up at each of their respective community forums for some technical help. I am sure that someone there is willing to help you set up a gaming server for Minecraft and such, just to get a game on from time to time.

Another alternative is to actually have a real MMO game, provided that you already have a game and geared for MMO connections. And this can get way too technical, attempt at your own risk or be prepared to be **flamed**!

## Automated Robots

There are those types of scripts and bots that requires an ongoing connection and always running 24/7, in order to see its true effectiveness. Like a data scalping script or expert advisor in Forex, or one of those types of bots that automatically click ads on Paid To Click sites (and hopefully still make a lot of money before getting banned). A VPS service allows this, so that we don&#8217;t have to keep our home machines running and overheating instead. Also, think about the data quota on the home bandwidth for running this!

# Where to get a VPS?

There are plenty online if you do a quick search but my recommendation is with <a class="thirstylink" href="http://blog.qoyyuum.me/endorses/vpshost/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HostWinds</a>. Tip: If you happen to use HostWinds, go ahead and use this coupon &#8220;**QUICKVPS**&#8221; to get 25% OFF on any VPS plans.
