So many connections and yet, I hardly ever know what these people do. Though its nice to have such connections but I&#8217;m gonna have to do a clean-up and clear out the connections that I don&#8217;t find of either value or want to stay in contact with. Sorry peeps. Don&#8217;t take it personal.

Kinda makes me want to visit [ReferralKey.com](http://referralkey.com/). Visited that site long time ago only to find more clients. Didn&#8217;t work. I might not be using it properly or the people that I&#8217;ve been trying to network there aren&#8217;t interested in web development and design services. Considering to close my account there.
