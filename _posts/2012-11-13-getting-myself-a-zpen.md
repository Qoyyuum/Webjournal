I have always wanted myself this Z-pen but never got around to actually buying one. And now I will. Pretty nifty as I&#8217;m gonna use it for taking down minute meetings, sketches and whatnot. Writing down &nbsp;or sketching something and then scanning it has been a recent disadvantage for me. If anyone in Brunei wants one, we can share the shipping fees (and maybe custom tax fee?). I will be placing an order this Friday so you have until then to decide to order with me. If you do, just comment below or send me a message or <a href="http://forrst.me/Qoyyuum" target="_blank">contact me</a> how many do you want and I&#8217;ll place an order. Deposit is optional but recommended.
