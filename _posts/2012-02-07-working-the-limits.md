So ever since I switched my workspace, I had to work the limit of dealing in web development within such a small screen resolution of 800 x 600. I was trying to tweak this out the last weekend but it was annoying that I can&#8217;t Google anything to get me a better screen size of the virtual box.

Its not easy trying to download these things over the lack of speed and consistency i.e. the local ISP." border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/working-the-limits-connection.jpg?resize=640%2C33" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

And thanks to TelBru, I&#8217;ve gotta download and re-download Community Builder component everytime I finished and checked its content. Because everytime it did finish, there were only a few files in it or at least one READ ME text file that I find of no use. Its 2am and I&#8217;m not even 60% done yet. Could use some assistance.
