Sweet! I&#8217;ve just discovered that Standard Chartered have this Top-up feature available. I saw this when I logged in to my ibank account via the website.

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">
      <a href="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SCBTop-Up_Feature.png" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="mybillpayment.com via Standard Chartered iBanking site. Nifty way to top-up your mobile credits." border="0" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SCBTop-Up_Feature.png?resize=640%2C340" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">
      #Standard Chartered Bank #SCB #MyBillPayment #Urgent Top-up
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I don&#8217;t know why but if I go directly to [their website](http://www.mybillpayment.com/) and register, it doesn&#8217;t work. I tried registering from SCB&#8217;s ibanking, it works. Maybe its a bug or something but whatever it is, it sure helped me a lot in a jiffy. I am able to top-up from here rather than going out and hope the shop still have a $40 easi card available.

Hmm&#8230; \*Added to mental note\*
