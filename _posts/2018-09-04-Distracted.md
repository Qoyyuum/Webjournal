For the past month, I have been on a roll. I read more ebooks, watch more tutorial videos, participate in forum discussions, share information and other neat resources online. But I don't feel as focused as I should be when it comes to goals or the goals that I have set. Don't get me wrong, I have been progressing on my Forex build after realizing my current strategy isn't as fast as I wanted it to be (i.e. trading with Kumo). But because of this, I branched out to find another strategy to work on.

## What my current strategy can and can't do

Trading with Kumo is an interesting study based off the many periods before the current tick to determine future pricing/prediction. Having the tick breakout of the cloud several ticks after the previous breakout was about 1 or 2 days long to wait for an actual entry (and exit if the existing order is still running). The trades went smoothly when I have done it manually. Problem is that the trades take too long to enter and too long to exit. Even the backtest proved that it will take a year to see some major gains (unless I add Money Management features in to manage risk per lot size to my margin).

## What I plan to add to my existing strategy

A few Forex trader friends I had in the past kept showing me to trade the naked chart and just use Japanese Candlestick Pattern. Last night, I managed to look into it, and it has its pros and cons as well. It only works best on smaller timeframes and has smaller TP and SL in comparison to my strategy. But there are more opportunities to enter and exit in rapid succession in comparison. Problem with this is that I have to memorize what the pattern look like. This also works for those who are impatient to see their profits (like my wife lol).

## What I should do

Create the 2 EAs and release these as part of my Signal subscription. 1 EA for long-term trading and the other for short-term trading. Have to make sure that the magic number doesn't clash haha.

## But....

I get distracted because of the other parts of Internet is asking for my attention for. Learning up on Artificial Intelligence, NLP, Machine Learning, PyTorch, and much more because I wanted to make these:

* A software like JARVIS but calling it [Naomi](https://github.com/NaomiProject/Naomi/)

* [Self-driving car](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot)

* Quant trading

```
var me = "screwed";

while (me == "screwed")
{
	echo "FML";
}
```

That also left me wondering if I should pursue to get Masters or a degree since I'm into studying all of this anyways. Hoping that there would be some University offering online courses, I thought of Udacity which lead me to a Nanodegree program in [AI for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880). Pretty neat but so is the price. I think its worth it.
