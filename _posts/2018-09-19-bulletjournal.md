I was intrigued at the idea of bullet journaling. Thought I'd give it a try. Then I realized how sucky my handwriting is. Such horror. Although, the framework that [Bullet Journal](https://reddit.com/r/bulletjournal) has is interesting. Makes me want to try and do it digitally. Until I found that I can't quickly change bullet points into different format as fast enough as I could when I jot down notes during my online studies.

## BulletJournal vs Blogging

How it differs from blogging is different in a way to Twitter is to other Social Media. You're limited to a number of characters to get a point across as fast as possible. Blog or this journal that I'm writing up right now, we can put in as much as we want, more fluff, more analogies, pictures, videos, embedded, even style codes and so on. Bujo (short for BulletJournal) just gets to the point. Trying to go digital with Bujo has become a challenge for me in note taking. But I've decided to split the framework into apps that already does the job and makes note taking a whole lot faster.

## IFTTT

Ah, the beauty of automation. For all new tasks, we can enter them all as a new card in Trello or Todoist. For all notes, I enter them in Google Keep (for personal use) and OneNote (for work). Each of these are already indexed, searchable and saved on a per day basis. Now I feel way more comfortable bullet journalling my way digitally instead of seeing the horror of my handwriting. LOL!

And a bonus, I added a few IFTTT recipe. Google Assistant > Add a Task > creates new entry to Todoist. Todoist has Google Calendar sync and I keep my notes in Google Keep. Everything is just connected with just a few apps that I have to maintain and installed as I go through the test of time.

Having the internet work for you is so awesome.
