I love them. I love how creative these comic book artists that publishes them on the web for all to see for free. Especially my favorites are TheOatMeal, XKCD, Least I Could Do, Looking For Group, and my most recent favorite, The Awkward Yeti.

I have always loved these webcomics. Way more varieties as opposed to reading the newspaper funnies. Sure, I still love reading Peanuts, Dilbert and Garfield as opposed to Nancy and the rest of comics, but I feel like their trying too hard to push the punchline.

And then I saw <a href="http://www.comicshuffle.com/" target="_blank">Comic Shuffle</a>. A definite bookmark in my browser to read even more webcomics! -1 for Productivity, +10 to Procrastination, +5 empty spaces in my bookmark webcomics folder.

Comic Shuffle only have 29 comic sites (quality webcomic sites), that I feel like a good start to read through. I&#8217;ve been an avid webcomic reader since 2000 and will continue to be.

## Webcomics and Graphic Novel that I look forward to

<!--more-->One webcomic that I have kept close eye on for new updates is the 

<a href="http://monstermarkupmanual.com/" target="_blank">MonsterMarkupManual</a> &#8211; a webcomic on coding. It&#8217;s an awesome initiative and considering how busy the artist is, I guess once a month update is not bad, but I would love to see it updated on a weekly basis instead.

The other part is more of a graphic novel than a webcomic/comic. It&#8217;s a graphic novel about programming but the storyline is much more or less like Harry Potter series (or so I&#8217;ve heard and read off from <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/secret-coders-gene-yang/" target="_blank">Wired</a>).  Already, the first look and preview of this graphic novel is very interesting. Though I hope it&#8217;s just something like a tangent learning to programming where the readers learn about Computer Science (or the way I perceive this as Computer Magic), would be awesome.

If anyone is interested in owning it, you can get it off from <a href="http://amzn.to/1gYZIql" target="_blank">Amazon for as low as $5 </a>in Paperback.
