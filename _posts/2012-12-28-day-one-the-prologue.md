Today, I would like to set a few goals and then see if I actually made money in a span of 1 to 6 months. And here they are:

**1.** <a href="http://blog.qoyyuum.me/2012/09/weekend-web-project.html" target="_blank"><b>A local product searching website.</b></a> &#8211; This website is all about products from all shops and stores in Brunei. Enabling consumers to find the products conveniently and answering the question &#8220;Where is the closest place to buy <Insert Product name>?&#8221;. Revenue Method will be brainstormed after this is developed and filled via CrowdSourcing. Made a plan over at&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/102146313345435500422" target="_blank">+Schemer</a>&nbsp;so if anyone is interested in working on this web project, we could split the profits&#8230; Somehow.

**2.** **[Forex.](http://blog.qoyyuum.me/2012/05/fx-building-my-ea.html)** &#8211; This was a big trend in the early year 2000&#8217;s in Brunei. Thanks to my dad teaching me some of the basics, I know how to use indicators, do manual trading, day scalping, play by the news, forecasting by patterns, etc. Though because its unstable and at a low initial deposit ($1000), the income isn&#8217;t so great (At most $60 a day, average $180 a week). Now moving into making it into an Expert Advisor but coding it takes a lot of time to make it stable.

**3.** **Commission from online freelancing.** &#8211; So I have my brother here. He doesn&#8217;t work, doesn&#8217;t find a job, doesn&#8217;t make any money at all. Just eats, sleeps, play games and lives with my parents. So I have decided to work with him as an agent. I find him online contracts, he does the work, I take a small commission. Though his &#8220;self-discipline&#8221; and &#8220;motivation&#8221; to work is something to work on. <span style="color: red;">Anyone got any good tips on whipping up a potential employee to have better working habits and changing his childish mindset?</span>

I have several goals in mind but at the moment, I will be focusing on the above stated goals. So basically, its 2 potential passive income and one active income. Would love to work with someone on goal number 1 and 2.
