# Learn To Code

There are a lot of online resources out there that teaches you to code or program. Here at Anak IT, we strive to make this learning experience fun and unique to everyone striving to be the next best programmer or coder. So instead of struggling with textbooks, here are some online resources that teaches you to learn to code while at the same time, play some games!

## Learn to Code Tactically with [CodeCombat](http://www.codecombat.com/)

Ever feel like swinging a sword or blocking with a shield with coding? You could if you played CodeCombat. This game teaches you Javascript, Coffeescript, Python, and a few other languages (currently at time of writing, still experimental). Your goals are set by each dungeon and you are to use all of the functions in each level to solve it. It’s free to play and learn!

Bonus: If you’re an expert already, you can create custom levels and design if you join their [github project here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat). It uses CoffeeScript by the way.

## Learn to Code Strategically with [Screeps](http://igg.me/at/screeps/x/68831)

This one is new and upcoming on indiegogo. It is an MMO Strategy game but with less mouse-clicking and keyboard shortcuts, and more scripting with Javascript. Check out the video below:



The simulation game was awesome. You may need some level of understanding with Object Orient Programming and Arrays before attempting to play this game but fun nonetheless! Feeling strategic? Support the project by contributing some funds for their game project and let’s play, while of course learn to code!
  


## Learn to Code in Real-Time Action with [Hack ‘n’ Slash game](http://www.hacknslashthegame.com/)

Lastly, there’s a game that plays quite similar to the Legend of Zelda world. But instead in this world, you can change… things. Like the behavior of each game element and object, the attributes, the stats, the modes, and much more! It doesn’t really teach you to code but you might be able to grasp the understanding of game elements through this game of what each asset can do if you change its state.
