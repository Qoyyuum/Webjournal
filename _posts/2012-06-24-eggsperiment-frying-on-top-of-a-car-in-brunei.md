24th of June 2012, I decided to try and fry an egg in this blazing heat in Brunei. First, I checked the weather. It was 35 Degree Celsius throughout from morning to afternoon. It was good enough for me.

Next, I looked for a frying pan, some butter, an egg and a spot to fry. The frying pan have some wear and tear at the bottom but its OK.

## Step 1: Pre-heat the pan

Got the pan, put it on top of the car and let it sit for 10 minutes. Time was 12:41pm. The pan wasn&#8217;t too hot but it was hot for my fingers though.

</div>

## Step 2: Add butter

At time 12:51pm, I took half of a spoon of butter and dunk it on the pre-heated pan. Immediately saw it melt and a couple of bubbles showing. I let it sit for 10 minutes. Time was 12:52pm.

</div>

## Step 3: Add egg

At 1:03pm, took an egg, cracked it and sort of spilled it on the pan. Wind blew and caused the egg yolk to circle around the pan. Looks like a monsoon wind pattern. Bubbles immediately form. Looks like effervescence. Wait for 10 minutes.

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

## Step 4: Time Check and Egg State

Time was 1:15pm. The egg yolk has partially harden. No sign of egg whites forming nor being cooked. Continue waiting for another 10 minutes. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

## Step 5: Time Check and Egg State

Time was 1:28pm. The egg yolk continues to harden. Small signs of egg whites forming and hardening but at the same time, bubbles burst under it. Doesn&#8217;t look delicious enough to eat. Considering it takes double time to see egg whites forming, I wait for 20 minutes. 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/o18.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Brunei Eggsperiment - Frying an egg on top of the car." border="0" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.qoyyuum.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/o18.jpeg?resize=640%2C480" title="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

## Step 6: Time Check and Egg State

Went and check on the state of the egg and whether the egg whites are completely formed, cooked and edible. Time was 1:54pm. Looking at the state of the egg (just poke around), parts of the egg yolk is still &#8220;gooey&#8221; or in a liquid form. Egg whites are in bubbles forming little tiny islands throughout the pan. Butter was still present.

### <u>**In Conclusion**</u>

Looking at this, I can only conclude that its not hot enough to fry an egg on top of a car. Factors observed and noted are: 

  * Cold sudden winds
  * Flies
  * The shape of the car&#8217;s top (everything in the pan slided to the edge and not on the center)

So theory of frying an egg out of the open is not possible. My next eggsperiment is frying an egg _inside_ a closed car. To be explored next weekend.
