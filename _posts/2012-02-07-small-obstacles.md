One problem after another. But nothing like ubuntu community forum can&#8217;t fix. These small obstacles are taking most of my productivity hours in building the site. Luckily I only have to do this once. Now I have this piece of $h!t to deal with:

> XAMPP: Error 127! Couldn&#8217;t start ProFTPD.

Looking up for answers. Anyone got a quick fix for this?

Even better, I&#8217;ve gotta get a better LaTex Editor. geditor just won&#8217;t cut it. Post your comments for anything better.
