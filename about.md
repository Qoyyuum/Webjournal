# About Me

A lot about myself can be found with a simple Google search. But if you want everything regurgitated into one site, I put it up on my **[about.me page.](www.about.me/qoyyuum)**


# About this blog

A bit of history here. Started off with Friendster way back in 2004. Introduced to the world of blogging from there. Then I moved to Google's Blogger in 2009 and I left behind everything in Friendster (too personal to move). Not a lot of what I can do from there. And since Google dropped a few services, I was afraid that Blogger might be next. At the same time, I was using Joomla! 2.5, an overpowered CMS for blogging. Then I migrated to Wordpress in 2015 and started afresh. A whole year after that I moved to using Jekyll. And it feels awesome!

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at:
